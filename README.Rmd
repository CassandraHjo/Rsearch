## Installation

You can install the development version of Rsearch from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools)
devtools::install_github("CassandraHjo/Rsearch")
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
