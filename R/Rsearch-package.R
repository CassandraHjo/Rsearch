#' Rsearch
#'
#' An R package designed for handling and analyzing targeted sequencing data.
#' Many of its functions are based on the command-line based tool VSEARCH.
#' By integrating VSEARCH into an R package, Rsearch provides significant utility
#' by making the software more accessible to a broad user base,
#' particularly those who prefer or require an R-based workflow. In addition to
#' the VSEARCH-based functions, Rsearch includes additional tools to aid
#' in microbiome data analysis, such as data processing functions and visualizations
#' of some of the results from the functions.
