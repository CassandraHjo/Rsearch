Description: An R package designed for handling and analyzing targeted sequencing data. 
  Many of its functions are based on the command-line based tool VSEARCH. 
  By integrating VSEARCH into an R package, Rsearch provides significant utility 
  by making the software more accessible to a broad user base, 
  particularly those who prefer or require an R-based workflow. In addition to 
  the VSEARCH-based functions, Rsearch includes additional tools to aid 
  in microbiome data analysis, such as data processing functions and visualizations 
  of some of the results from the functions.
