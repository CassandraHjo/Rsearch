\usage{
vs_optimize_trim(fastq_input, reverse, minovlen = 10, minlen = 0, threads = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{fastq_input}{A FASTQ file path or object containing (forward) reads.}

\item{reverse}{A FASTQ file path or object containing (reverse) reads See Details.}

\item{minovlen}{The minimum overlap between the merged reads. Must be at least 5. Defaults to \code{10}.}

\item{minlen}{The minimum number of bases a sequence must have to be retained. Defaults to \code{0}. See Details.}

\description{
Optimizes trimming to get the best possible merging results. The function searches for the best parameters by looping through different parameter values for the trimming options.
}
\details{
The function uses \code{\link{vs_fastq_mergepairs}} and \code{\link{vs_fastx_trim_filt}} where the arguments to this function are described in detail.
