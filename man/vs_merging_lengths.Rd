\title{Length statistics after merging}
\usage{
vs_merging_lengths(
  fastq_input,
  reverse,
  minovlen = 10,
  minlen = 0,
  threads = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fastq_input}{A FASTQ file path or object containing (forward) reads.}

\item{reverse}{A FASTQ file path or object containing (reverse) reads.}

\item{minovlen}{The minimum overlap between the merged reads. Must be at least 5.
Defaults to \code{10}.}

\item{minlen}{The minimum number of bases a sequence must have to be retained.
Defaults to \code{1}.}

\item{threads}{Number of computational threads to be used by \code{vsearch}.
Defaults to \code{1}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item \code{length_1}: The length of the forward reads.
  \item \code{length_2}: The length of the reverse reads.
  \item \code{length_merged}: The length of the merged reads.
  \item \code{length_overlap}: The length of the overlap between the forward and reverse reads.
}

In case of missing values for the latter two columns, it means that the
corresponding reads were not merged.

The data frame has an attribute \code{plot} containing a \code{\link{ggplot2}}
object based on the returned data frame.

The data frame also has an attribute \code{statistics} containing the same
attribute returned from \code{\link{vs_fastq_mergepairs}}.
}
\description{
Statistics of read lengths before and after merging.
}
\details{
This function calculates the length of the forward reads, reverse reads,
the merged reads, and the overlap lengths. It uses \code{\link{vs_fastq_mergepairs}} where
the arguments to this function are described in detail.

These length statistics are most typically used in order to tune the filter
and trimming of reads such that the merged reads are of high quality.
