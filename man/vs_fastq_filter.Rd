\item{fastq_maxee_rate}{threshold for average expected error. Value ranging form 0.0 to 1.0. See Details.}

\item{fasta_width}{number of characters in the width of sequences in the output FASTA file. See Detalis.}

\item{threads}{number of computational threads to be used by vsearch.}

\item{log_file}{name of the log file with messages from running vsearch or NULL, see Details.}

a tibble with FASTA sequences

\description{
Trim and/or filter sequences in the given FASTQ file
}
\details{
The reads in the input FASTQ-file (\code{fastq_file}) are filtered based on ..., using vsearch.

If \code{fastaout} is specified, the remaining sequences after trimming/filtering are output to this file in FASTA-format.
If unspecified (\code{NULL}) the result is returned as a FASTA-object, i.e. a tibble with
columns \code{Header} and \code{Sequence}.

Sequences with an average expected error greater than the specified \code{fastq_maxee_rate} are discarded.
For a given sequence, the average expected error is the sum of error probabilities for all the positions in the sequence,
divided by the length of the sequence.

FASTA files produced by vsearch are wrapped (sequences are written on lines of integer nucleotides).
\code{fasta_width} is by default set to zero to eliminate the wrapping.

#' If \code{log_file} is specified, the messages are output to this file.
If unspecified (\code{NULL}) no log file is written.
