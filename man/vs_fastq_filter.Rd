\description{
Quality filtering of sequences in FASTQ file or object
}
\details{
The reads in the input FASTQ-file (\code{fastq_file}) are filtered based on ..., using vsearch.

\code{fastq_input} can either be a FASTQ file with reads or a FASTQ object. The FASTQ object needs to be a tibble
with columns \code{Header}, \code{Sequence} and \code{Quality} (like the one outputed from \code{vs_fastq_mergepairs()}).

If \code{fastaout} is specified, the remaining sequences after quality filtering are output to this file in FASTA-format.
If unspecified (\code{NULL}) the result is returned as a FASTA-object, i.e. a tibble with
columns \code{Header} and \code{Sequence}.

Sequences with an average expected error greater than the specified \code{fastq_maxee_rate} are discarded.
For a given sequence, the average expected error is the sum of error probabilities for all the positions in the sequence,
divided by the length of the sequence.

FASTA files produced by vsearch are wrapped (sequences are written on lines of integer nucleotides).
\code{fasta_width} is by default set to zero to eliminate the wrapping.

#' If \code{log_file} is specified, the messages are output to this file.
If unspecified (\code{NULL}) no log file is written.
