\arguments{
\item{fastx_input}{A FASTQ/FASTA file path or a FASTQ/FASTA object (tibble), see Details.}

\item{fastx_output}{Name of the output file for dereplicated reads from \code{fastx_input}. File can be in either FASTA or FASTQ format, depending on \code{file_format}. If \code{NULL} no sequences will be written to file. See Details.}

\item{file_format}{Format of input files \code{fastx_input} and \code{fastx_output}, and desired output format: \code{"fasta"} or \code{"fastq"}. Determines the format for both outputs.}

\item{minuniquesize}{The minimum abundance value post-dereplication for a sequence not to be discarded.}

\item{strand}{\code{"plus"} or \code{"both"}. When comparing sequences only check the plus strand or both strands.}

\item{sizein}{Decides if abundance annotations present in sequence headers in \code{fastx_input} should be taken into account.}

\item{sizeout}{Decides if abundance annotations should be added to headers in output table or output file (\code{fastx_output}).}

\item{relabel_sha1}{Relabel sequences using the SHA1 message digest algorithm.}

\item{relabel}{Relabel sequences using the given prefix and a ticker to construct new headers.}

\item{fasta_width}{Number of characters per line in the output FASTA file. Only applies if the output file is in FASTA format. See Details.}

\item{fastq_qout_max}{If \code{TRUE}, the quality score will be the highest (best) quality score observed in each position.}
}
\value{
If \code{fastx_output} is not specified, a tibble containing the dereplicated reads is returned. If \code{fastx_output} is specified nothing is returned.

\description{
Dereplication of sequences in FASTA/FASTQ file or object.
}
\details{
The reads in the input file/object (\code{fastx_input}) are dereplicated by merging identical sequences, using \code{vsearch}.
Identical sequences are defined as sequences with the same length and the same string of nucleotides (case insensitive, T and U are considered the same).

\code{fastx_input} can either be a FASTA/FASTQ file with reads or a FASTA/FASTQ object. If provided as tibble, it must contain the columns \code{Header}, \code{Sequence}, and \code{Quality} or the columns \code{Header} and \code{Sequence}, depending on \code{file_format}.

If \code{fastx_output} is specified, the dereplicated sequences are output to this file in format given by \code{file_format}.
If unspecified (\code{NULL}) the result is returned as a FASTA/FASTQ object, depending on \code{file_format}.

By default, the quality scores in FASTQ output files will correspond to the average error probability of the nucleotides in the each position.
If \code{fastq_qout_max = TRUE}, the quality score will be the highest (best) quality score observed in each position.

FASTA files produced by\code{vsearch} are wrapped (sequences are written on lines of integer nucleotides).
\code{fasta_width} is by default set to zero to eliminate the wrapping.
