\arguments{
\item{fastq_input}{A FASTQ file path or a FASTQ object containing (forward) reads. See Details.}

\item{reverse}{A FASTQ file path or a FASTQ object containing (reverse) reads See Details.}

\item{output_format}{Desired output format of file or tibble: \code{"fasta"} or \code{"fastq"} (default).}

\item{fastaout}{Name of the FASTA output file with the joined reads.
If \code{NULL} (default) no output will be written to file. See Details.}

\item{fastqout}{Name of the FASTQ output file with the joined reads.
If \code{NULL} (default) no output will be written to file. See Details.}

\item{join_padgap}{The padding sequence to use in the gap between the sequences. Defaults to \code{"NNNNNNNN"}.}

\item{join_padgapq}{The quality of the padding sequence. Defaults to \code{"IIIIIIII"},
corresponding to a base quality score of 40 (a very high quality score with error probability \code{0.0001}).}

\item{fasta_width}{Number of characters per line in the output FASTA file.
Only applies if the output file is in FASTA format. Defaults to \code{0}. See Details.}

\item{log_file}{Name of the log file to capture messages from \code{vsearch}.
If \code{NULL}, no log file is created. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{threads}{Number of computational threads to be used by \code{vsearch}. Defaults to \code{1}.}
}
\value{
Tibble or \code{NULL}.

If output files are not specified, a tibble containing the joined reads in the format
specified by \code{output_format} is returned. If an output file is specified,
results are written to file and nothing is returned.

\description{
Joins paired-end sequence reads into one sequence with a gap between them.
}
\details{
The read-pairs in the input FASTQ-files (\code{fastq_input} and \code{reverse})
are joined into one sequence by adding a gap between them with a padding sequence, using \code{vsearch}.
The resulting sequences consist of the forward read, the padding sequence and the reverse complement of the reverse read.

\code{fastq_input} and \code{reverse} can either be FASTQ files or FASTQ objects.
FASTQ objects are tibbles that contain the columns \code{Header}, \code{Sequence}, and \code{Quality}.
Forward and reverse reads must appear in the same order and total number in both files.

If \code{fastaout} or \code{fastqout} is specified, the joined reads are output
to this file in either FASTA or FASTQ format.
If unspecified (\code{NULL}) the results are returned as a FASTA or FASTQ object,
and no output is written to file. \code{output_format} has to match the desired output files/objects.

FASTA files produced by \code{vsearch} are wrapped (sequences are written on lines of integer nucleotides).
\code{fasta_width} is by default set to zero to eliminate the wrapping.

Any input sequence with fewer bases than the value set in \code{minlen} will be discarded.
By default, \code{minlen} is set to 0, which means that no sequences are removed.
However, using the default value may allow empty sequences to remain in the results.

If \code{log_file} is specified, the messages and joining statistics are output to this file.
If unspecified (\code{NULL}) no log file is written.

# Read example FASTQ files
