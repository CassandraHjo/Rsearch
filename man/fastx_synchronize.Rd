\usage{
fastx_synchronize(
  file1,
  file2,
  file_format = "fastq",
  file1_out = NULL,
  file2_out = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file1}{A FASTQ/FASTA file path or a FASTQ/FASTA object (tibble), see Details.}

\item{file2}{A FASTQ/FASTA file path or a FASTQ/FASTA object (tibble), see Details.}

\item{file_format}{Format of input files \code{file1} and \code{file2}, and desired output format of tibbles: \code{"fasta"} or \code{"fastq"}. Determines the format for both outputs.}

\item{file1_out}{Name of the output file for synchronized reads from \code{file1}. File can be in either FASTA or FASTQ format, depending on \code{file_format}. If \code{NULL} no sequences will be written to file. See Details.}

\item{file2_out}{Name of the output file for synchronized reads from \code{file2}. File can be in either FASTA or FASTQ format, depending on \code{file_format}. If \code{NULL} no sequences will be written to file. See Details.}
}
\value{
If output files are not specified, a tibble containing the synchronized reads from \code{file1} is returned. The tibble containing the synchronized reads from \code{file2} is an attribute to the primary table (\code{sync_file1}).
This table can be accessed by running \code{attributes(sync_file1)$sync_file2} or \code{attr(sync_file1, "sync_file2")}.
If output files, \code{file1_out} or \code{file2_out}, are specified nothing is returned.
}
\description{
The function synchronizes sequences in two FASTA/FASTQ files or objects, by retaining the common sequences.
}
\details{
\code{file1} and \code{file2} can either be FASTQ/FASTA files or FASTQ/FASTA objects. If provided as tibbles, they must contain the columns \code{Header}, \code{Sequence}, and \code{Quality} or the columns \code{Header} and \code{Sequence}, depending on the \code{file_format}.
In order for the synchronizing to work, it is necessary that the sequence IDs in the \code{Header}s are identical for each read pair in the two files.

If \code{file1_out} or \code{file2_out} are specified, the remaining sequences after synchronizing are output to these files in either FASTA or FASTQ format depending on \code{file_format}.
If unspecified (\code{NULL}) no output is written to file, and the synchronized reads are returned as a FASTQ/FASTA object (tibble). \code{file1_out} or \code{file2_out} must either both be \code{NULL} or both \code{charachter}.
