vs_derep_fulllength(
  fasta_input,
  output = NULL,
  minuniquesize = 1,
  strand = "plus",
  sizein = TRUE,
  sizeout = TRUE,
  relabel_sha1 = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{fasta_input}{a FASTA file with reads or a FASTA object, see Details.}

\item{output}{name of the FASTA-file with the output or NULL, see Details.}

\item{minuniquesize}{minimum abundance value post-dereplication for sequence not to be discarded.}

\item{strand}{plus or both. When comparing sequences only check the plus strand or both strands.}

\item{sizein}{decides if abundance annotations present in sequence headers should be taken into account. True by default.}

\item{sizeout}{decides if abundance annotations should be added to FASTA headers.}

\item{relabel_sha1}{relabel sequences using the SHA1 message digest algorithm.}

\item{relabel}{relabel sequences using the given prefix and a ticker to construct new headers.}

\item{fasta_width}{number of characters in the width of sequences in the output FASTA file. See Details.}
}
\value{
a tibble with FASTA sequences with columns \code{Header} and \code{Sequence}.
}
\description{
Dereplication of sequences in FASTA file or object.
}
\details{
Identical sequences in the input file/object are merged, using vsearch.
Identical sequences are defined as sequences with the same length and the same string of nucleotides.

\code{fasta_input} can either be a FASTA file with reads or a FASTA object. The FASTA object needs to be a tibble
with columns \code{Header} and \code{Sequence}.

If \code{output} is specified, the remaining sequences after quality filtering are output to this file in FASTA-format.
If unspecified (\code{NULL}) the result is returned as a FASTA-object, i.e. a tibble with
columns \code{Header} and \code{Sequence}.

FASTA files produced by vsearch are wrapped (sequences are written on lines of integer nucleotides).
\code{fasta_width} is by default set to zero to eliminate the wrapping.
