\usage{
vs_fastq_mergepairs(
  fastq_input,
  reverse,
  fastqout = NULL,
  log_file = NULL,
  threads = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fastq_input}{A FASTQ file path containing (forward) reads or a FASTQ object (tibble), see Details.}

\item{reverse}{A FASTQ file path containing reverse reads or a FASTQ object (tibble), see Details.}

\item{fastqout}{Name of the FASTQ output file for merged sequences. If \code{NULL} no FASTQ output file will be written to file. See Details.}

\item{log_file}{Name of the log file to capture messages from vsearch. If \code{NULL}, no log file is created.}

\item{threads}{Number of computational threads to be used by vsearch.}
}
\value{
A tibble, \code{merged_fastq}, containing the merged FASTQ sequences, with columns \code{Header}, \code{Sequence} and \code{Quality}.

The statistics from the merging, \code{statistics}, is an attribute of \code{merged_fastq}. This tibble contains merging statistics, including number of pairs, number of merged pairs, and length metrics.
The statistics can be accessed by running \code{attributes(merged_fastq)$statistics} or \code{attr(merged_fastq, "statistics")}.
}
\description{
Merging read-pairs with overlapping regions.
}
\details{
The read-pairs in the input FASTQ-files (\code{fastq_input} and \code{reverse}) are merged if they have sufficient overlap, using vsearch.

\code{fastq_input} and \code{reverse} can either be FASTQ files or FASTQ objects. If provided as tibbles, they must contain the columns \code{Header}, \code{Sequence}, and \code{Quality}.

If \code{fastqout} is specified, the merged reads are output to this file in FASTQ-format.
If unspecified (\code{NULL}) the result is returned as a FASTQ-object, i.e. a tibble with columns \code{Header}, \code{Sequence} and \code{Quality}.

If \code{log_file} is specified, the messages are output to this file. If unspecified (\code{NULL}) no log file is written.
