\usage{
vs_fastq_mergepairs(
  fastq_file,
  reverse,
  fastqout = NULL,
  log_file = NULL,
  threads = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fastq_file}{a FASTQ-file with forward reads (R1).}

\item{reverse}{a FASTQ-file with reverse reads (R2).}

\item{fastqout}{name of the FASTQ-file with the output or NULL, see Details.}

\item{log_file}{a log file with output from vsearch.}

\item{threads}{number of computational threads to be used by vsearch..}
}
\value{
A list with two tibbles, one with merged fastq sequences and one with merging statistics. If
\code{fastqout} was specified....
}
\description{
Merging read-pairs with overlapping regions.
}
\details{
The read-pairs in the input fastq-files (\code{fastq_file} and \code{reverse})
are merged if they have sufficient overlap, using vsearch.

If \code{fastqout} is specified, the merged reads are output to this file in fastq-format.
If unspecified (\code{NULL}) the result is returned as a fastq-object, i.e. a tibble with
columns \code{Header}, \code{Sequence} and \code{Quality}.
