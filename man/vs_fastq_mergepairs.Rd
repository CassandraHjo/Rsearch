\usage{
vs_fastq_mergepairs(
  fastq_file,
  reverse,
  fastqout = NULL,
  log_file = NULL,
  threads = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fastq_file}{a FASTQ-file with forward reads (R1).}

\item{reverse}{a FASTQ-file with reverse reads (R2).}

\item{fastqout}{name of the FASTQ-file with the output or NULL, see Details.}

\item{log_file}{name of the log file with messages from running vsearch or NULL, see Details.}

\item{threads}{number of computational threads to be used by vsearch.}
}
\value{
A list with two tibbles:
\describe{
  \item{merged_fastq}{A tibble containing the merged FASTQ sequences, with columns \code{Header}, \code{Sequence} and \code{Quality}.}
  \item{statistics}{A tibble containing merging statistics, including number of pairs, number of merged pairs, and length metrics.}
  }
}
\description{
Merging read-pairs with overlapping regions.
}
\details{
The read-pairs in the input FASTQ-files (\code{fastq_file} and \code{reverse})
are merged if they have sufficient overlap, using vsearch.

If \code{fastqout} is specified, the merged reads are output to this file in FASTQ-format.
If unspecified (\code{NULL}) the result is returned as a FASTQ-object, i.e. a tibble with
columns \code{Header}, \code{Sequence} and \code{Quality}.

If \code{log_file} is specified, the messages are output to this file.
If unspecified (\code{NULL}) no log file is written.
