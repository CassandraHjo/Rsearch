\description{
Trimming sequences in FASTQ file or object
}
\details{
The reads in the input FASTQ-file (\code{fastq_input}) are trimmed based on the specified number of bases for each en of the read, using vsearch.

\code{fastq_input} can either be a FASTQ file with reads or a FASTQ object. The FASTQ object needs to be a tibble
with columns \code{Header}, \code{Sequence} and \code{Quality} (like the one outputted from \code{vs_fastq_mergepairs()}).
\code{reverse} is an optional argument, for when you want to trim two files at a time (e.g. forward and reverse reads).
It can either be a FASTQ file with reads, a FASTQ object or \code{NULL}. The FASTQ object needs to be a tibble
with columns \code{Header}, \code{Sequence} and \code{Quality} (like the one outputted from \code{vs_fastq_mergepairs()}).
If unspecified (\code{NULL}), only \code{fastq_input} is trimmed.

If \code{fastqout} is specified, the remaining sequences after trimming are output to this file in FASTQ-format.
If unspecified (\code{NULL}) the result is returned as a FASTQ-object, i.e. a tibble with
columns \code{Header} and \code{Sequence}.

Sequences with an average expected error greater than the specified \code{fastq_maxee_rate} are discarded.
For a given sequence, the average expected error is the sum of error probabilities for all the positions in the sequence,
divided by the length of the sequence.
