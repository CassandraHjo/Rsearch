\arguments{
\item{fastq_input}{A FASTQ file path containing (forward) reads or a FASTQ object (tibble), see Details.}

\item{reverse}{An optional FASTQ file path containing reverse reads or a FASTQ object (tibble), see Details. If provided, it will be processed alongside \code{fastq_input}.}

\item{output_format}{Desired output format of tibble: \code{"fasta"} or \code{"fastq"}. Determines the format for both forward and reverse outputs.}

\item{stripright}{The number of bases stripped from the right end of the reads.}

\item{stripleft}{The number of bases stripped from the left end of the reads.}

\item{fastaout}{Name of the FASTA output file for primary sequences (forward reads). If \code{NULL} no FASTA output file will be written to file. See Details.}

\item{fastqout}{Name of the FASTQ output file for primary sequences (forward reads). If \code{NULL} no FASTQ output file will be written to file. See Details.}

\item{fastaout_rev}{Name of the FASTA output file for reverse reads. If \code{NULL} no FASTA output file will be written to file. See Details.}

\item{fastqout_rev}{Name of the FASTQ output file for reverse reads. If \code{NULL} no FASTQ output file will be written to file. See Details.}

\item{minlen}{The minimum number of bases a sequence must have to be retained. Default is 0. See Details.}

\item{fasta_width}{Number of characters per line in the output FASTA file. Only applies if the output file is in FASTA format. See Details.}

\item{threads}{Number of computational threads to be used by \code{vsearch}.}
}
\value{
If output files are not specified, a tibble containing the trimmed reads from \code{fastq_input} in the format specified by \code{output_format} is returned. If output files are specified, nothing is returned.

If \code{reverse} is specified, the resulting tibble (\code{trimmed_reverse}) containing the filtered reverse reads in the format specified by \code{output_format} is an attribute to the primary table (\code{trimmed_seqs}).
This table can be accessed by running \code{attributes(trimmed_seqs)$trimmed_reverse} or \code{attr(trimmed_seqs, "trimmed_reverse")}.

\description{
Trimming sequences in FASTQ file or object
}
\details{
The reads in the input FASTQ-file (\code{fastq_input}) are trimmed based on the specified number of bases for each en of the read, using \code{vsearch}.
If a \code{reverse} input is provided, it trims the reverse reads similarly. The output format for both primary and reverse sequences is determined by the \code{output_format} parameter.

\code{fastq_input} and \code{reverse} can either be FASTQ files or FASTQ objects. If provided as tibbles, they must contain the columns \code{Header}, \code{Sequence}, and \code{Quality}.
\code{reverse} is an optional argument to the function. If provided, it will be processed alongside \code{fastq_input}, meaning the same \code{stripright} and \code{stripleft} will be used for both FASTQ objects.

If \code{fastaout}, \code{fastqout}, \code{fastaout_rev}, or \code{fastqout_rev} are specified, the remaining sequences after quality filtering are output to these files in either FASTA or FASTQ format.
If unspecified (\code{NULL}) no output is written to file. \code{output_format} has to match the desired output files.

FASTA files produced by \code{vsearch} are wrapped (sequences are written on lines of integer nucleotides).
\code{fasta_width} is by default set to zero to eliminate the wrapping.

Any input sequence with fewer bases than the value set in \code{minlen} will be discarded. By default, \code{minlen} is set to 0, which means that no sequences are removed.
However, using the default value may allow empty sequences to remain in the results.
