\description{
An R package designed for handling and analyzing targeted sequencing data.
Many of its functions are based on the command-line based tool VSEARCH.
By integrating VSEARCH into an R package, Rsearch provides significant utility
by making the software more accessible to a broad user base,
particularly those who prefer or require an R-based workflow. In addition to
the VSEARCH-based functions, Rsearch includes additional tools to aid
in microbiome data analysis, such as data processing functions and visualizations
of some of the results from the functions.
